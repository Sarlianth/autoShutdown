# Auto-Shutdown

Program is pretty much self explanatory. Enter the time for which the computer is to shutdown. When the time reaches 0 your computer will automatically turn off.

Very useful in situations when you're watching someting to sleep and don't want to be bothered turning off the laptop after the movie. This software can do it for you.
